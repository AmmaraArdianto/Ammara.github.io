            Hello there! I'm <b>Ammara</b>. I have the biggest love for many things such as anime, manga, and my many other hobbies. This website is supposed to be meant for a fun project for my technology class where I make a personal website with html. Luckly during the summer I was taking some free html classes, so I have some experience with this coding language. This is supposed to present my many different interests and why I like them. I hope you enjoy!

      <h3 id="FLCL">FLCL</h3>
      <p>FLCL aka FoolyCooly, is an old anime made in the early 2000s. Made by the same studio who contributed in Evangalien. It has themes about puberty and the meaning of many things but said in figurative ways. It's a wacky anime, that has a special place in my heart because the themes, teh animation, the characters, the development, and the other personal memories I had with it. It's one of those animes, that I will cherish forever.</p>
      <img src="Media/flcl.jpg" alt="FLCL Cover">
      
      <h3 id="DM">Dungeon Meshi</h3>
      <p>Dungeon Meshi, is a unique take on fantasy dungeon genres. It explores multiple themes and also creates delcious meals that looks so edible through the screen. Not only that, but it expands more on the outside world. Every character has a unique design, and experiments with many characters. At first it seems very simple anime but as you go into it, you realize the ever expanding world and characters it has. Made by the same studio who is kinda besties of FLCL, made Panty and stockings with garterbelt, Gurren Laggan, AND MANY OTHER ANIMES THAT I LOVED.</p>
      <img src="Media/DM.png" alt="Dungeon Meshi Cover">
      
      <h3 id="SANDA">Sanda</h3>
      <p>Sanda made by the same mangaka that produced beastars and others. Also the daugher of the creator of Baki. Sanda is a special anime, it has so many secrets and every dialogue has secret meaning into it. Allowing me to look back and every scene and theroize what would happen next, therozie how other characters feel for each other,or even about the school the students are confined into. It's made by Science Saru which made the anime Scott Pilgrim anime and Dandadan which are two shows that I loved dearly as well.</p>

      <h3 id="Drawing">Drawing</h3>
      <p>Drawing is one of my favorite things to do on my free time. It's is literally vital to me and if my ability of drawing is removed, I would get really depressed. I would start since I was a baby, My family has history of artistic ability mostly on my father's side. Anyways, I love drawing, it gives me happines and it gives me life. The sweet satisfaction when Im done with a drawing or done with a really good sketch or coloring the happiness is astronomical. I would often draw doodles just for fun. Sometimes I draw a focus on the human nature and psychology. Either happy or sad sort of like Avogadro9. Either the realistic side or a more figurative side of it. In short I love drawing and it is vital to me.</p>
      
      <h3 id="Acting">Acting</h3>
      <p>Acting, I love acting. I love imaging myself in different situations depending on the script and acting those different emotions. Unforunately I'm not that funny, I'm a hit or miss. Though I don't do these often because I do not have those kind of opprotunties. Though it's sort of fun and nervewracking.</p>
      
      <h3 id="Volleyball">Volleyball</h3>
      <p>Volleyball, I got into it during 8th grade. I was naturally good at diving and reciving the ball. Then later in 9th grade because of neccesiaty I was forced into being a setter. Even though we didn't go up to the top 3 for MIST 2025 game. My team ended up winning 5th place with some mishaps. Now I'm captain, I really need to lock in. I haven't been feeling that passionate spirit for it as of yet. I dont know why, it makes me sad.</p>
      
      <h3 id="Writing">Writing</h3>
      <p>Writing is actually fun, even essaies are fun to write. Nonfiction or fiction though it might depend on the subject. Recently I've been writing a lot more. A story called "A Goodboy's Tradgedy" I honestly named it that for clickbait and a nod to some of the insipration the book have which is "A Good Girls Guide to Murder". Depending on the assignment and question, I can even enjoy some of the essaies that are assigned for class, for some reason it gives some sort of joy. I usually want a focus in exploring deeper subjects that has to use reasoning and explainations for it. Which makes my mind very nice and happy.</p>

        <h3 id="Reading">Reading</h3>
        <p>Reading is fun at times, only sometimes. I only really liked fictional thrillers, which is what ive seen. Some nonfictions such as the one im reading right now which has to deal with the the school system and prompoting a system of thinking. </p>
      <h3 id="Film">Film</h3>
      <p>Film, I also don't do these often. I love the colors and composition of the visuals. Also the writing can do a lot as well and audio AUDIO IS THE MOST IMPORTANT.</p>
